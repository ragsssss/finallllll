<p style = "text-align: center;font-size: 20px"> ok lol um idk where to start so i just want you to know one thing. Know that no matter what comes in our way, I will never stop loving you. <br>
You give me happiness that nobody has ever given to me. Our souls were made for each other and you know it. We're supposed to be together. Everything <br>
about us being together makes sense. You have the ability to make everything okay for me. I love you in every way that's possible and I hope that <br>
never changes. Like you're so special to me. You don't even know.You deserve everything perfect and I'll try my best to give that to you. <br>
I'm not perfect by any means but I want to be perfect for you. I want to do the best for you. I want to support you forever. Thank you for being you.<br></p>
